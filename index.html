      <p> The data on loan accounts from Grameen America was filtered to remove
      non-categorical columns. One-hot encoding of the remaining categories produced a
      sparse data set, and the dimensionality was reduced using principal component
      analysis. The resulting data set was grouped into five data sets using k-means
      clustering and compared to the original data for insight.
